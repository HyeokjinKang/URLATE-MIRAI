Hello, this is Hyeokjin Kang (Coupy), the developer of URLATE LITE.  
Thank you so much for your patience. At last, **URLATE LITE** is now officially in **Early Access**!  
Early Access begins at the time this post is published. Please see below for the full details.

---

## üïπÔ∏è Overview

**URLATE LITE** is a rhythm game built on an older client base.  
Due to this, the current build lacks optimization and polish in many areas, and a full-scale rework is planned.  
However, as this will take considerable time and effort, we‚Äôve decided to launch the current version in Early Access  
to share with those who have been waiting, even if it‚Äôs still rough around the edges.

---

## üéØ Purpose of Early Access

This Early Access release is intended to:

- Gather player feedback to improve the overall quality of the game
- Involve players in shaping the direction of content and difficulty tuning
- Collect foundational data for future updates and the full release

Your insights will play a key role in how URLATE LITE evolves going forward.

---

## üîß Early Access Roadmap

During the Early Access period, we plan to continuously update the game with a focus on:

- Adding new patterns
- Adjusting difficulty and pattern design
- Improving UI/UX
- Fixing bugs and enhancing stability
- Performance optimization

---

## üìÖ Early Access Schedule

Early Access officially begins on **May 17, 2025, at 10:30 PM (KST)**.  
It will continue until the official release. All gameplay records and data during this period  
will be preserved after the full launch.

---

## üöÄ How to Play

**URLATE LITE** is a browser-based game that runs on any platform (except mobile).  
You can start playing right now by visiting [URLATE LITE](https://urlate.coupy.dev/).  
We recommend using **Google Chrome**, as other browsers may not function correctly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes on Early Access

- While all data recorded during Early Access will be retained after the full release,  
  some data may be reset in the event of pattern changes or technical issues.

- As this is a development build, bugs and other issues may occasionally prevent normal gameplay.

---

## üìù Final Notes

The last update was all the way back in August 2024.  
At that time, I had mentioned that the early version would likely be released by the end of 2024.  
I'm truly sorry to have kept you waiting this long.  
Balancing personal responsibilities and development took more time than expected.

There are still many missing patterns and system shortcomings,  
but I will continue working hard to improve the game with your help and feedback.  
Thank you sincerely for your continued interest in **URLATE LITE**,  
and I hope you‚Äôll stay with us on this journey.
