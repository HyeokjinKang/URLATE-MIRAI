## Introducing URLATE LITE

> URLATE, a community-driven rhythm game project.

URLATE LITE is a community-driven rhythm game project based on URLATE, a rhythm game project that was in service until 2022.  
We aims to create a rhythm game that can be played by anyone, anytime, anywhere, and is a project that has been in development since June 2023.  
We are currently preparing for the official release, and we are planning to release it in early 2024.

### How URLATE LITE is different from URLATE

URLATE LITE is a non-profit game, so we have redesigned all aspects of finance in accordance with the characteristics of non-profit games.  
Thanks to the fact that we do not generate any revenue, we were able to be free in terms of the number of songs and resource usage, and all the songs that are currently confirmed to be included are in a situation where free use has been agreed upon with the copyright.  
The server is also supported by Megazone Cloud and Oracle Cloud's Free Tier, so there is no operating cost, and there are no other costs.

URLATE LITE has solved the biggest problem of URLATE, which was the financial problem, so we can promise that there will never be a sudden closure of the game.

### New features

URLATE LITE has been developed for about 4 months since June 2023, when this article was written, and 336 commits (changes) have been made, so URLATE has changed rapidly and many parts have been changed or improved.  
If you are familiar with GitHub, you can visit the [URLATE](https://github.com/HyeokjinKang/URLATE) repository to see more details.  
If you are looking for more systematic information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://mirai.urlate.coupy.dev/docs).

#### New UI

Especially, the in-game UI has been completely changed to a more modern and simple design.

#### Deletion of all revenue-generating elements

In order to operate the game as a non-profit game, all revenue-generating elements such as stores have been deleted, and the content is kept open to the public.
