Hello, this is Coupy, the developer of URLATE.  
It has been 10 months since the last update on the development of URLATE LITE.  
I informed you in the article published last year that URLATE LITE would be released earlier this year, but the release was delayed. I am writing this article to inform you of the detailed progress of the project and the expected release date.
## Detailed Project Development Progress
Based on the records of [Github Projects](https://github.com/users/HyeokjinKang/projects/3) and the history of the [URLATE Repository](https://github.com/HyeokjinKang/URLATE), I will guide you through the development progress so far.

## Summary of Project Progress
The rework of the game system is complete, and much of the feature development has been completed, with [v1.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/HyeokjinKang/URLATE/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.2) released. The following are the additional tasks that need to be completed.
- Development of a new index (pre-login) page
- Enhancement of the achievement system
- Completely new tutorial
- Profile reporting feature

The game development is almost complete, but there are obstacles to the game's release.
## Pattern Production Progress
URLATE LITE patterns consist of three elements: notes, bullets, and triggers.
Compared to other rhythm games, URLATE LITE has a much higher difficulty in creating patterns. The density of bullets must be high to increase the visual completeness, so thousands of bullets must be planted for each pattern, and notes that match those bullets must be placed.
The pattern production took much longer than expected, so the delay in the release of the game was inevitable.
Thirteen patterns have been created so far, which accounts for 15% of the total 84 patterns that need to be created.
We decided to hold a pre-open before the release because we thought the project would be delayed too much if we continued at this pace.
## Pre-Open Schedule
URLATE LITE will be pre-opened when at least one pattern is created for each of the 28 songs in URLATE LITE.
The records during the pre-open period will be maintained even after the official release, and the expected pre-open date is the end of 2024.
We are making every effort to present patterns of various difficulty levels, so we ask for your support and interest.
## Conclusion
URLATE LITE has become a non-profit project, and it has been deprioritized in my personal affairs, but I am making every effort to release the game with high completion.
It may take a little longer, but I will do my best to repay you with satisfactory results. Thank you.
