# Welcome to URLATE!

This is the documentation for URLATE, an open-source rhythm game built with web technologies.  
This documentation is categorized into two sections:

- [Users](./users/user-guide) : Guide for users to play URLATE.
- [Developers](./developers/developer-guide) : Guide for developers to contribute or create custom content for URLATE.

You can skip the following section if you are not interested in the background of URLATE.

## What is URLATE?

URLATE is a rhythm game combined with a bullet shooting game.  
You have to move the cursor to avoid bullets coming from all directions and process the notes at the right timing.

Team Croissant developed URLATE from 2019 and released the first demo version in 2020.  
In 2020, we ran a crowdfunding campaign on [Tumblbug](https://tumblbug.com/urlate), and thankfully we reached the goal with the support of many people.  
After the crowdfunding, we ran two Closed Beta Tests to reflect user feedback.  
URLATE was officially released on November 11, 2021, but we couldn't find a way to sustain the game due to various difficult situations, despite our efforts to improve the game and operation and to reconcile the team.

URLATE was closed on 2022, but we decided to open the source code and assets to the public.  
`URLATE-v3l` is a project to create and distribute an open-source game based on the game URLATE, which was discontinued.  
We hope this project will be a great open source rhythm game for everyone.

## URLATE-v3l

After changed the name of the project to `URLATE-v3l`, we changed and fixed a lot of things.  
Major changes are as follows:

- The UI has been almost redesigned.
- In-game graphics have been improved.
- New type of note, `Hold Note` has been added.
- Now we don't generate revenue from the game, so we removed the shop system.
- As we don't have to consider the revenue, many well-known songs are included in the game.
- We added a profile system that can boast the best records or record achievements such as competitions.
- ..and many more!

## We are looking for contributors!

URLATE-v3l is an open-source project, so anyone can contribute to the project.  
If you are interested in contributing to the project, please refer to the [Developer Guide](./developers/developer-guide).
